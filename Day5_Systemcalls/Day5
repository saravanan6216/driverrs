One of the purpose of kernel services is to provide various resources to application.

Most of the operating systems put their kernel in a previllaged region /protected region.

Applications are placed in low privillaged mode / user mode .

Process of adding a new system call:
------------------------------------
/usr/src/linux-source-5.4.0/linux-source-5.4.0


 1.vi ./arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd32.h
 vi ./arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd.h
 
 2. vi ./include/linux/syscalls.h
 
3./usr/src/linux-source-5.4.0/linux-source-5.4.0/kernel$ vi sysctl.c


Events: Kernel code is based on events
1. process events
2. interrupt/device events : higher priority ,scheduler disabled


open:
----
open->sys_open->cdev.fops->open->driver_open()
1. verify caller request and enforce driver policy 
2. verify target dev status (wakeup)
3. allocate resources if needed.eg:per application


close:
------
close->sys_release->cdev.fops->release->driver_release()
1. opposite to open implementation
